# Ronnie-s-Destination-Diary

Ronnie has been taking notes of destinations across the country and has compiled a catalog of information to guide your next adventure.
Included in the website are park info and images and locations of mountain ranges throughout the continguous states that Ronnie has documented.
The most interesting feature of the website is the filtering of park search criterias. It uses revolutionary uses of functions and other elements
to categorize information. Another notable feature of the website is the mountain notes page. It lists mountain notes through an array to load mountain
info and their respective images.
